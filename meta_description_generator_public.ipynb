The most popular meat is shawarma chicken. Chicken is a healthy choice for your diet, especially the way it is slow cooked (or you could choose from the delicious vegetarian or vegan meals).\\nIf you want to avoid the fat content, eat smaller portions of the pita bread. The assortment of vegetarian and vegan dishes are a delight and the calorie content is low. Only the freshest ingredients are used in the Lebanese dishes. Food is prepared with olive oil instead of butter or cream. This makes the dishes naturally low in fat. The delicious flavor of Lebanese food is heightened by the most common of seasonings as opposed to sauces or rich gravies. The spices enhance the flavor\\nof the vegetable or meat without sacrificing health. Every day spices used most often to prepare Lebanese foods are mint, parsley, oregano, garlic, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Vegetables and fruits provide the largest portions of each meal\\ncompared to meats. Common vegetables used in meals of Lebanese cuisine include eggplant, cabbage, green beans, and cauliflower. Nearly every meal of the day includes either flat bread or a pita. Pita bread\\nis high calorie but very low in fat having only 1 gram per medium piece of pita bread. Sodium may be higher than the health conscious person prefers. The offsets are in the nutrients in the organic, fresh ingredients, very low fat\\ncontent. The fat is also natural. Nuts are used in some of the Lebanese dishes. Nuts are a naturally nutritious food. Hummus is a popular Lebanese side dish. The chickpeas in Hummus are a significant source of protein and dietary fiber. Not to mention, Hummus is truly delicious! Two other side dishes served with Lebanese cuisine are lentils and rice. Both of these side\\ndishes are naturally low in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium. Both of these side dishes compliment the entr\\u00e9e with their rich flavor. The Mediterranean salads are a health lover\\u2019s choice. With less than 80 calories and the additional flavor of garlic and vegetables, this is a delicious and filling dish. There are many fresh ingredients and nutritious meals\\nto choose from when eating Lebanese cuisine if you are watching your caloric intake. Lebanese food is rich and often carries higher sodium. Avoid that second helping of medium Pita bread. Stopping at one piece keeps your calorie intake\\ndown and make note that it is naturally low in fat. Eat smaller portions so that you enjoy the rich, flavorful taste of Lebanese dining. Choose from some naturally good dishes rich in garlic, eggplant, cauliflower, okra, lemons or\\nonions. These compliment the entr\\u00e9e and keep the calorie conscious diner happy.\",\n\"Lebanese cuisine includes the vegetarian, vegan, and meat diet. The most popular meat is shawarma chicken.
